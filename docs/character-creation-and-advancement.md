# Character Creation & Advancement

With the campaign setting and rules established, players can now begin forming their group and creating their characters. Players should share character concepts, public backstories and how their PCs might know one another.

## Campaign Length

Depending on how it goes, if the campaign has legs I'll run it as long as possible. I have run games that last years. That depends on player enjoyment, attendance consistency, attitude and burnout. I'm happy to take the characters all the way to level 20. Given how rusty I am, scaling may be a bit of an issue at first, as I need to gauge how quickly characters will advance to promote long term gameplay. So if you want to plan for that dream multiclass character you've been itching to play, go for it.

## Starting Level

All characters are starting at 1st level. If new characters are needed (replacements, new players, etc.) they will be starting at an appropriate level for where the rest of the party is currently at.

## Group Composition

I encourage everyone to play what they want to play. If everyone wants to play fighters, I'll work with that. Don't play something just because you think we "need a healer" or anything like that. If players want to discuss it, that's fine, but don't make it a motivation.

## Background Prompting

- Why is your character an adventurer?
- What's your reason for joining the party? Is it a secret reason?
- Have you had a major event in your life that defined you? How did it happen? Do you want the game to touch on this?
- Have you wronged anyone in your life to date? Has anyone wronged you? Do you want the game to touch on this?
- What, if anything, would you kill to find out or discover?

## Party Relationships

Do any of the characters know each other before the adventure begins? Are there romantic, strong friendship, familial, supportive, or antagonistic relationships? Are any of the character concepts that may cause conflict in the party? I do not encourage this, but will work with it if needed. Discuss it with me first. I would like everyone to not play evil characters, I've got that side covered. Chaotic is fine.

## History & Background

- **Character History** - Where did the character grow up? Just a "type" of town or a specific named place that must be fleshed out by the DM? 
- **Backgrounds** - How do backgrounds affect the characters lifestyle? As a DM, I typically will not limit or require approval backgrounds, although there may be some minor modification or prodding to fit into the game world / campaign. Given the mechanics associated with backgrounds, I would encourage players to use the ones from the book and not homebrew anything, which could make character creation difficult or complicated or unbalanced.
- **Special NPCs** - What special or historical NPCs (family, mentors, etc.) may be encountered? Does the character maintain any relationships with historical NPCs? I do allow predefined NPC relationships, but they must be developed & maintained "in-game".

## Factions & Reputation/Renown

- **Factions** - Characters can start off as a member of a faction, if desired. If so, let me know, I have several candidates already.
- **Renown** - Characters cannot start off with Renown, it must be earned.

## Stat Generation

- **Min/Maxing** - I do not encourage trying to min/max your characters. It turns the game from role-playing into mechanical tweaking. If players want to do this, that's fine, but don't encourage others to do it if they don't want to or glorify it. As long as it doesn't become an issue, we'll be fine. Please note, this doesn't mean more experienced players SHOULDN'T help newer players with character creation choices. Just don't drive them into a min/max mentality. I prefer well-rounded playable characters to ones that intentionally break systems. It's fine to play an unoptimized character.
- **Creation Stats (House Rule)** - We will be rolling stats in our Session Zero. This is not so I can validate the results, it's to make sure people are doing it right. We will be using a house rule stat generation system to help mitigate the "crunchy level 1" problem. We will be rolling 7 sets of 4d6 die, dropping the lowest of the 4 die, and then dropping the lowest set. This will give us a skewed set of 6 attributes, which will be allocated to the stats desired. This ensures we don't have a stupid wizard or a scrawny fighter or clumsy thief. We are going for somewhat "heroic" stats.

## Hit Points

**Take The Max** - At starting level ONLY, characters will take the max hit points possible allowed by their normal hit die roll. Again, this leads to more heroic characters and mitigates level 1 crunchiness. Future hit points for additional levels will be rolled. Same with new characters created at higher level later (1st level max, roll additional levels).

## Alignment

We will be using alignment in this campaign. Alignment is used as a "guide" for character behavior. Game mechanic wise I will consider alignment primarily in some circumstances:

- **Detect X** - ***Detect Evil & Good*** spells directly pertain to alignment, and the spell will react appropriately.
- **Inspiration** - If a character makes a difficult choice to adhere to his alignment, I may award inspiration for that choice. Conversely, acting against your alignment may LOSE inspiration.
- **Piety** - Acting according to your alignment and deity guidance is directly related to gaining piety.

Other circumstances may arise.

- **Alignments Disallowed** - I strongly encourage not playing an evil character. We're all on the same side here. Chaotic is fine.
- **Alignment Change** - Alignments can change, either through a conscious character choice or game effect. This has the largest impact on class features or piety, but if its forced unwillingly it will be temporary and some game mechanic will be available to resolve and return to normal.

## Classes & Sub-Classes

- **Classes/Sub-Classes Allowed** - We will be sticking to classes & sub-classes from the PHB, DMG, Tasha's Cauldron, and Xanathar's Guide. Unearthed Arcana is right out. I do not encourage designing "homebrew" or tweaked classes or sub-classes.
- **Multiclassing** - Multiclassing is allowed but players should be aware that some multiclass combination can be game breaking or character crippling. As the DM, I reserve the right to correct for both of these situations through house rules if they arise. As 1st level characters, this should not really come up in character creation, but feel free to plan for it. I would encourage you to let me know in advance if you plan to multiclass eventually and how you plan to do it, but that can be a later decision. This also lets me get a head start on ruling on them that may impact your class decisions.

## Species & Sub-Species

- **Races/Sub-Races Allowed** - We will be sticking to races & sub-races from the core books, Tasha's Cauldron, and Xanathar's Guide. Unearthed Arcana is right out. I do not encourage designing "homebrew" or tweaked races or sub-races.

## Spells

- **Spells Allowed** - I do not limit any spells, however I do want to stick to the core books, Tasha's Cauldron, and Xanathar's Guide. Unearthed Arcana is right out. I do not encourage designing "homebrew" or tweaked spells.

## Feats

We will be using the Feats Optional Rule, wherein the character can take a feat in place of the ability score improvement when leveling. You must meet any feat prerequisites.

- **Feats Allowed** - I do not limit any feats, however I do want to stick to the core books, Tasha's Cauldron, and Xanathar's Guide. Sensing a theme here? Unearthed Arcana is right out. I do not encourage designing "homebrew" or tweaked feats. Yes, the Lucky feat is allowed.
- **Variant Human Traits (PHB, p. 31)** - We will be using the variant human traits that include feat options.

## Gold, Equipment, Magic Items, & Mounts

- **Starting Gold (PHB, p. 143, House Rule)** - All characters start with maximum gold for their class.
- **Starting Equipment** - Players are expected purchase all starting equipment out of their starting gold amount. Players should use the costs straight from the core books. Do not purchase magic items or mounts. Any magic items will have to be purchased "in game". Mounts will be covered initially. Special mounts will not be allowed for starting characters and will have to be earning "in game".

## Experience

- **Earning Experience** - Players earn experience through defeating monsters or in rare cases from accomplishing major goals. Experience is added up by the DM throughout the game session, and awarded at the end. All players who participate in the session will earn the same experience. I do not do story milestones, although events that would normally be considered a milestone may award experience. Characters can level up between game sessions. You cannot train to gain levels, you must adventure.](<# World & Campaign

Wherein we find out what this is all about...

## World Setting

- **World** - Veldoria is a world rich with life and magic, and not all of it is friendly. Nature started drinking mana potions and may have gotten a little tipsy. There are tame regions around the cities and villages, but stray too far into the wilds and you will need backup...sometimes LOTS of backup.
- **Starting Point** - Characters will be starting in the town of Port Emberhaven, a small port coastal town on the eastern shore of Veldoria's westernmost major land mass. The town is a fishing community and crossroads town for communities deeper into the western Veldoria continent. It is a center of trade for the region. It's three days ride from the Netherwood Forest and six days ride from the foothills of the Wildmount Spine. It collects agricultural goods from other local towns and hamlets for export by ship. Port Emberhaven is in the province of the Western Marches, and the local lord is Elmsworth Vane, who resides in Port Emberhaven. The Western Marches is the westernmost province of the realm of the kingdom of Lyria, but is a distant province from the capitol city of Lyr, as the entire province is across the Gulf of Ember from the main body of Lyria and trade with the rest of the kingdom is mostly by ship. Theron Blackwood is the current king of Lyria. The closest town to Port Emberhaven is Weywood, on the edge of the Netherwood Forest.
- **In-Game Adventurers** - We will be leaning in on heroic characters, with character creation and house rules to support that. However, they will be "baby heroes" at first. There will be factions that can be joined (i.e. guilds). NPCs may be friendly or unfriendly with the PCs, depending on their disposition.

## Key Locations

- **Lord's Manor** - Home of Lord Elmsworth Vane.
- **The Crooked Tankard** - The town community tavern & inn run by innkeeper Angus Broadfoot.
- **The Dragon's Breath Forge** - The town smithy run by Jorg Ingtar.
- **The Salt & Compass Mercantile** - A combination outfitter, general store and trading post that acts as the hub of trade for the region. Owned and operated by the husband and wife team of Edran Harbryn and Lyssa Harbryn.
- **The Port Emberhaven Meloran Temple** - The local temple to Melora, goddess of the wilderness and the sea. Run by Tarina Tidewell, the town cleric.
- **The Port Emberhaven Market** - An open air market where many traders, merchants, and locals may come to temporarily set up shop and sell goods. Edran Harbryn manages the space out of The Salt & Compass Mercantile.
- **Port Emberhaven Docks** - The local dockyard run by the dockmaster Korvan Delreth.
- **The Mystic Tide Emporium** - The town magic shop and apothecary, run by Ellara Veyn.

## Politics & Factions

- **The Western Marches**, being somewhat removed from Lyria as a whole, is semi-independent. Lord Elmsworth Vane has a substantial amount of local authority, and he knows it. He doesn't want anything to draw the attention of King Theron Blackwood, as that would disturb his mini-kingdom.
- **The Guild of Sundered Scales** is a regional monster hunting guild in the Western Marches. The guild takes on contracts to investigate monster sightings, protect communities, and eliminate dangerous creatures. This close to the wilds, they serve a valued purpose and are respected.
- **The Shadow Corsairs** are a rumored smugglers/thieves guild believed to be operating out of Port Emberhaven. They may have a dockside presence.
- **The Port Emberhaven Guard**, led by Sheriff Silas Cragheart is the right arm of Lord Elmsworth Vane. They don't always agree with the Guild of Sundered Scales, but there is a measure of professional respect between the two organizations.
- The PCs should not start out as nobility or members of the government. They can start out as VERY junior members of the Port Emberhaven Guard, though. But remember there may be other players on the wrong side of the law. I would recommend talking to the other players about it first.
- The PCs can join a faction outright or help create new ones. They will be encouraged to join the Guild of Sundered Scales, which is locally considered an honor. 

## Character vs. Player Campaign Knowledge

The characters have all grown up in the Western Marches. Having lived most of their lives in the region, they know they major players outlined above, but not necessarily at a personal level. Depending on background, more details may be know by specific PCs in particular areas. Not everyone will know everything, however, and some information may be conveyed to the players via sidebar conversations. The players may elect to inform the other members of their party or not, depending on their inclination.>)
