Wherein we find out what this is all about...

- **World Setting** - Veldoria is a world rich with life and magic, and not all of it is friendly. Nature started drinking mana potions and may have gotten a little tipsy. There are tame regions around the cities and villages, but stray too far into the wilds and you will need backup...sometimes LOTS of backup.
- **Starting Point** - Characters will be starting in the town of Port Emberhaven, a small port coastal town on the eastern shore of Veldoria's westernmost major land mass. The town is a fishing community and crossroads town for communities deeper into the western Veldoria continent. It is a center of trade for the region. It's three days ride from the Netherwood Forest and six days ride from the foothills of the Wildmount Spine. It collects agricultural goods from other local towns and hamlets for export by ship. Port Emberhaven is in the province of the Western Marches, and the local lord is Elmsworth Vane, who resides in Port Emberhaven. The Western Marches is the westernmost province of the realm of the kingdom of Lyria, but is a distant province from the capitol city of Lyr, as the entire province is across the Gulf of Ember from the main body of Lyria and trade with the rest of the kingdom is mostly by ship. Theron Blackwood is the current king of Lyria. The closest town to Port Emberhaven is Weywood, on the edge of the Netherwood Forest.
- **In-Game Adventurers** - We will be leaning in on heroic characters, with character creation and house rules to support that. However, they will be "baby heroes" at first. There will be factions that can be joined (i.e. guilds). NPCs may be friendly or unfriendly with the PCs, depending on their disposition.
- **Key Locations** - 
	- **Lord's Manor** - Home of Lord Elmsworth Vane.
	- **The Crooked Tankard** - The town community tavern & inn run by innkeeper Angus Broadfoot.
	- **The Dragon's Breath Forge** - The town smithy run by Jorg Ingtar.
	- **The Salt & Compass Mercantile** - A combination outfitter, general store and trading post that acts as the hub of trade for the region. Owned and operated by the husband and wife team of Edran Harbryn and Lyssa Harbryn.
	- **The Port Emberhaven Meloran Temple** - The local temple to Melora, goddess of the wilderness and the sea. Run by Tarina Tidewell, the town cleric.
	- **The Port Emberhaven Market** - An open air market where many traders, merchants, and locals may come to temporarily set up shop and sell goods. Edran Harbryn manages the space out of The Salt & Compass Mercantile.
	- **Port Emberhaven Docks** - The local dockyard run by the dockmaster Korvan Delreth.
	- **The Mystic Tide Emporium** - The town magic shop and apothecary, run by Ellara Veyn.
- **Politics & Factions** - 
	- **The Western Marches**, being somewhat removed from Lyria as a whole, is semi-independent. Lord Elmsworth Vane has a substantial amount of local authority, and he knows it. He doesn't want anything to draw the attention of King Theron Blackwood, as that would disturb his mini-kingdom.
	- **The Guild of Sundered Scales** is a regional monster hunting guild in the Western Marches. The guild takes on contracts to investigate monster sightings, protect communities, and eliminate dangerous creatures. This close to the wilds, they serve a valued purpose and are respected.
	- **The Shadow Corsairs** are a rumored smugglers/thieves guild believed to be operating out of Port Emberhaven. They may have a dockside presence.
	- **The Port Emberhaven Guard**, led by Sheriff Silas Cragheart is the right arm of Lord Elmsworth Vane. They don't always agree with the Guild of Sundered Scales, but there is a measure of professional respect between the two organizations.
	- The PCs should not start out as nobility or members of the government. They can start out as VERY junior members of the Port Emberhaven Guard, though. But remember there may be other players on the wrong side of the law. I would recommend talking to the other players about it first.
	- The PCs can join a faction outright or help create new ones. They will be encouraged to join the Guild of Sundered Scales, which is locally considered an honor. 
- **Character vs. Player Campaign Knowledge** - The characters have all grown up in the Western Marches. Having lived most of their lives in the region, they know they major players outlined above, but not necessarily at a personal level. Depending on background, more details may be know by specific PCs in particular areas. Not everyone will know everything, however, and some information may be conveyed to the players via sidebar conversations. The players may elect to inform the other members of their party or not, depending on their inclination.
