Back to [Index](https://steven-stanford.github.io/sundered-scales-campaign/index)

Wherein we discuss conduct rules, establish expectations for behavior at the table, and identify any potentially sensitive or out-of-bound topics or ethical concerns...as well as methods to address them.

## General Conduct Rules

1. **Have Fun** - D&D is a role playing game, the most important thing to have is fun and ensure others are, as well. Enjoy the game! Feel free to be creative in how you want to do your actions.
2. **Be Considerate** - Both in and out of character! Although it can be fun to play a character who pushes buttons at times. D&D is a cooperative game where we all work together to have fun! Avoid disruptive gameplay that is undesirable.
3. **Be Respectful** - Everybody (DM, players, ***and*** characters) is expected to respect the other members and players, and all people are welcomed here. This includes treating each other with respect regarding, race, age, sexuality, gender, religion (or lack thereof), and other physiological or ideological characteristics/beliefs. Every person is entitled to this respect.
	- **Respect The Scene** - Try to keep meta talk to a minimum, as it breaks immersion.
	- **Respect The Players** - Don't joke about people's roleplaying skills. We are not all Actors Guild members. Don't tell players how to play, players should feel free to ask for what they need, so limit prompting or suggesting. It is best to learn by doing and making mistakes.
	- **Respect Ignorance** - We were all new at one point. We are here to learn and help.
	- **Respect The PCs** - Most people understand how important it is to respect others in the table. But not everyone knows it is just as important to respect the characters. Make sure the the other in-game characters are on board with what is happening!
4. **Be Civil & Kind** - Keep it nice, civil, & friendly. No harassment! Do not engage in:
	- Inappropriate conversation or mean-spirited insults (if you are asked to stop, stop immediately).
	- Forcefully telling others how they should play or act.
	- Intentional behavior that is hurtful.
5. **Be Communicative** - If you have a problem but don't tell anyone, there is no way for the problem to be resolved! They won't typically just "go away", and even if they do they may return. When someone is communication a concern, be respectful of their position. If you need a DM sidebar, just let me know. We need to be careful that one player's expectations don't ruin the fun of others.

## Table Behavior

- **Alcohol  & Weed** - There will be no alcohol or weed at the table, and this includes gummies & THC. I'm not an alcohol or weed/THC snob, but we may have minors present and it detracts from gameplay. If someone gets intoxicated or high, or worse shows up that way, we will see what we can do to get them home safely. They will not be playing. If it happens frequently, there will be a discussion with the player that may lead to a game ban. Let's not get to that point.
- **Narcotics** - Same considerations as alcohol, but may be more strict on consequences. This will lead to a game ban from the table MUCH more rapidly.
- **Smoking & Vaping** - I don't smoke/vape and I don't like the smell. I have sensitivities to it. If you do partake, please step away from the table, preferably outside. Our hosts have policies too.
- **Cellphones & Digital Devices** - I do allow devices at the table (I use a PC for my notes), but kindly request you limit their use to game play (digital books, notecards, characters, etc.) It's distracting and disrespectful to be scrolling at the table. If you need to step away to use a device for out-of-game purposes or take a call, that would be much more preferable so feel free. However, I ***do not*** allow headphone use at the table, you need to be able to pay attention and hear what is going on. I'll let you know if it starts to become a problem.
- **Player Attention** - In that same vein, please pay attention to the game. Distractions are easy and real (especially if you have ADHD or some similar condition) but try to focus. It helps to take notes and remain engaged. If a player is constantly distracted it can delay the game and break immersion. Again, I'll let you know if it starts to be a problem.
- **Courtesy** - Give others a chance to speak. Do not interrupt them, discourage them from talking, or from participating. It is reasonable to expect that some players will be more experienced and/or more comfortable when speaking and playing, and tend to “lead” the conversation, which is perfectly fine. But all players should try to be respectful of everyone else in the session. I will be doing my best to keep everyone involved and make sure ALL players are heard.
- **Swearing** - Swearing or cursing is allowed, but remember to respect our host and surroundings. If there are younger minors present (say in the store) please at a minimum keep your voice low. Sometimes it helps to swear "in setting terms" (i.e. frakking, flaming, blood & bloody ashes, or gorram). This can even bring color to a game, but may be difficult for players to remember. I'm not a language snob, and I typically don't play with those that are.
- **Controversial Topics** - This one is tough. The only thing I've seen kill a D&D group faster than Tiamat is an out-of-game religion or politics discussion, especially in this climate. We will be keeping any real-life topics like ***religion, politics, porn, or sex*** away from the table. These topics may cause friction within the gaming group. Many of these topics can lead to heated discussions that can be disruptive to a game session & upsetting to other players. Sports can be a tad disruptive, but once the game starts please try to focus. There may be other topics that come up as we play, and we will be utilizing our safety tools to manage. It is ok to talk about these kind of things before the session starts, but not during the session and away from the table. Remember there may be minors present. If players want to arrive early to socialize they can do that, but again keep it ***away from the table!***
- **Welcome Any Newbies** - Part of the fun of running a game is bringing in new players and exposing them to a new hobby. Players can help with this by being welcoming to new people. They may be feeling uncomfortable in a new setting or group. Everyone is welcome, including people of all race & creeds, and all levels of experience to gaming. Please be sure to encourage inexperienced players along, never put them down or discount them based on lack of experience as some people may have had bad experiences before.

## Ethical Concerns & Topics

Wherein we will be discussing in-game sensitivity issues and how we will handle them as a group...

### Ethics Preface

It is important to include a preface and a trigger warning to this topic-set. This part will cover mature topics which may or may not trigger people, it is not my intention to do so. This is in fact being discussed in Session Zero ***to avoid*** suddenly triggering players in gameplay. They can and should be discussed in a mature and respectful manner. These are not easy topics to discuss but should be regardless.  If I fall short in this, I ask for forgiveness in advance. Everybody has topics (in-game or out-of-game) that make them uncomfortable. We need to respect that and try to play a game that all can enjoy. For these topics, it is important to address every player at the table for their individual input & then individual consent.

### Lines and Veils

Some players may have hard ***lines*** (in-game topics that should never come up at all) to avoid. These may be certain themes such as no sexual violence, no harm to children, or no character-driven torture or harm to animals.

Some players may prefer to have theme ***veils*** (sensitive in-game topics to be handled off-screen or in the abstract) instead — keeping the details off-screen. Torture, slavery, sacrifice, and NPC-based harm to animals may be ok but only if they happen off screen. During the game, we don't dwell on veiled themes.

Lines and veils are a two-way street. The DM can mention what's off limits for the table, what's veiled, and what potentially sensitive topics might come up in the campaign. Players can mention other topics that may not have been mentioned but could cause problems if they do.

In Session Zero, we will define a list of lines and veils to begin with and the players will provide input during the session. We will discuss this list and add any other lines or veils that come up. The revised list will be sent out to the players. I will manage and maintain the list on an ongoing basis, as new themes may come up in game play via safety tools. 

### The X Card Safety Tool & Player Discomfort

Occasionally things may happen in-game that makes a player uncomfortable. There maybe times where everyone agreed about a particular topic in Session Zero, but when it actually surfaces in-game, the player may find out that they in fact are NOT comfortable with it. We will be handling this with a safety tool known as the [X Card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Card) by John Stavropoulos.

Even after you have a solid list of potentially troubling topics and a good idea of the table's lines and veils; there is the need for another safety fallback. Not everyone knows what will bother them until it starts coming up during the game. We need a tool that lets players communicate their discomfort without causing a big confrontation.

The DM puts a red 3x5 index card in front of each player with a giant X on it. If the game is going in a direction uncomfortable to a player, the player can tap or raise the X card and let the DM know they're not comfortable. The DM will either pause the game and have a discussion about what was going on if it was unclear, or simply move on bypassing the topic if it was obvious.

The person asking for the pause need not explain _why_ they're asking, if they don't wish to. It's important that the group respect the privacy of the person asking and recognize that they simply don't want something or want to steer the game away from certain subject matter.

### In-Game Sensitive Or Off-Limits Topics

We will be using ***Monte Cook's ["RPG Consent Checklist"](https://www.montecookgames.com/store/product/consent-in-gaming/)*** for this part of the discussion. Are there any sensitive topics that any of the players have? Are there any plot, story elements, or PC/NPC behaviors that may make anyone uncomfortable? Examples include, but are not limited to, fear of the dark, deadly cold, suicide or self-harm, genocide. Please note that this is in addition to out-of-game off limits topics, but just may be more about treading carefully for storytelling purposes or require the use of safety tools.

- **Gender** - We need to discuss gender roles, if any, in the game setting and the possibilities of encountering patriarchal or matriarchal cultures & how prevalent each are in this setting. What are the most common 'norms' for gender roles. I will bring up any species/race/culture in the setting that are known at this time that has off-set or extremist views from the general gender norms as described. We will also be discussing the topic of creatures, deities & magic items that can change gender, if any, & how common those are. (Succubus/Incubus come to mind.)
- **Attraction & Sexual Orientation** - We will discuss the possibilities of attraction or sexual orientation of both the PCs & the NPCs & the populous, in general, in the game setting. Is it alright for characters to experience attraction from others that may not match their personal views as a player? Will they be uncomfortable with seeing interactions in character that may not align to their personal views? Other sexual topics include:
	- Cultural variation & acceptance
	- Cultural stigmas on select sexual orientations
	- Individual empowerment views
	- Roles of religion or government in sexuality
- **Rape & Sexual Assault** - As a person, I find these activities abhorrent. However, historically they were a thing, and are often a source of drama even in modern movies. Tastefully managed through veils "off-camera", I personally do not take steps to exclude these topics from my campaign. Characters have been allowed to have such events in their backstory. However, if other players do not feel comfortable with even a veiled approach, in the interest of collective enjoyment I will avoid the topic and would encourage other players from bringing it up as well (backstory or otherwise).
- **Racism & Prejudice** - Similar to sexual assault, this is horrible and it's a reality. In fantasy settings sometimes people are judged not by their deeds & merit on a person by person basis, but instead by the cultural reality that elves tend to hate dwarves in a xenophobic way. This does not mean all elves do so. I'm more open to using these topics in game settings, because its so human and a source of drama, but players should feel free to voice any concerns.
- **Slavery** - Slavery is another historical ugliness that is an unfortunate source of drama. Slavery is typically part of most medieval and fantasy settings. Slave brutality will not be dwelled on and will be treated as veiled, but it may be mentioned. PCs may encounter slaves in some cultures or may even become temporarily enslaved themselves as a drama hook (remember player agency though). I find it acceptable to be included in a PCs background. Again, if the players voice their concern as part of the Session Zero discussion, this topic can be avoided.
- **Child Trafficking & Endangerment** - While a reality in these setting, I will not be dwelling on this. It may be mentioned ***way*** off camera as a cultural context, but this is not something I want my games to include as a theme. This is a line for me.

### Ethics Conclusion

These are being discussed now to avoid player discomfort later, so that everyone can have a fun game. At any time, even if it goes against what you agreed upon, or what was discussed during Session Zero, if you feel uncomfortable please say something (Rule #5 Be Communicative). The situation cannot be addressed if you keep it to yourself. At a minimum request a sidebar or have an out-of-session conversation with the DM.

## Discord Server Rules

All of the above rules also apply to the Discord server, but in addition...

- **No NSFW Content** - While this is an adult server, I want to keep it fairly safe for work. This means no posting of nudity, sexual images, real life gore/violence, promotion of hateful speech or behavior). Foul language is fine as long as it's not abusive.
- **Voice Courtesy** - While in Voice Chat, it is expected that everyone give others a chance to speak, not interrupting them, discouraging them from talking, or from participating.
- **Keep Content In Appropriate Channels** - This will help keep the server organized. If you think a conversation may derail into another discord topic, please move it to that particular thread on the server.

## Reporting Problems, Concerns or Harassment

If there is ever any issue where a player feels someone is breaking one of the above rules, is being disruptive, or harassing players, players should feel comfortable raising the concern in game. The DM expects the other players to be considerate, mindful, and listen to the concern. If for some reason the player DOES NOT feel comfortable raising the concern in game, please feel free to contact the DM for a private discussion and the issue will be addressed. Please be aware that the DM is human and does make mistakes, especially in complex "touchy feely" situations, but please be assured the best intentions are there to resolve any issues.

## Consequences

The DM should always attempt to resolve issues in a way that corrective behavior can be followed and allow all to continue playing and participating. However, failure to comply with the rules can result in the following:

- Verbal or written warnings
- Game suspension
- Permanent game ban

There is zero tolerance for harassment here, consider this your one and only warning if you are found violating this rule with malice aforethought.
